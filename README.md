### Description
The computer of the differences is a program that determines the difference between the two data structures. This is a popular task, for the solution of which there are many online services, for example, jsondiff. A similar mechanism, for example, is used in the output of tests or in automatic monitoring of changes in configuration files.

### Utility opportunities:
*1. Support for different input formats: yml(yaml), json*

*2. Generation of the report in the form of plain text, stylish and json*

Compares two configuration files and shows a difference.

positional arguments:
  first_file
  second_file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
                        set format of output, you can choose formats: stylish, plain, json, (default format: stylish)
```
```
gendiff tests/fixtures/file1.yml tests/fixtures/file2.yml
gendiff -f plain tests/fixtures/file1.yml tests/fixtures/file2.yml
gendiff --format plain tests/fixtures/file1.json tests/fixtures/file2.json
gendiff --format json tests/fixtures/file1.json tests/fixtures/file2.json

```

1. **Stylish style:** *Compares two configuration files and shows a difference in stylish format.
```commandline
*stylish is default format
gendiff tests/fixtures/file1.yml tests/fixtures/file2.yml
gendiff -f stylish tests/fixtures/file1.yml tests/fixtures/file2.yml
gendiff --format stylish tests/fixtures/file1.json tests/fixtures/file2.json
gendiff --format stylish tests/fixtures/file1.json tests/fixtures/file2.json

```

2. **Plain style:** *Compares two configuration files and shows a difference in plain format.*
```commandline
gendiff -f plain tests/fixtures/file1.yml tests/fixtures/file2.yml
gendiff --format plain tests/fixtures/file1.json tests/fixtures/file2.json

```

3. **Json style:** *Compares two configuration files and shows a difference in json format.*

```commandline
gendiff -f json tests/fixtures/file1.yml tests/fixtures/file2.yml

### How to find differences between two files:
Place two files that you want to compare in the tests/fixtures folder.
Follow the team to search for differences:
```commandline
gendiff -f plain tests/fixtures/file1.json tests/fixtures/file2.json

```
Replace file1.json and file2.json with your files
